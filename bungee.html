    Make unforgettable memories with a 160ft Bungee Jump in Glasgow. Bungee
    jumping offers an adrenaline-filled experience that will last a lifetime!
    The 160ft Bungee Jump at Glasgow offers an extremely exciting day out,
    less than a 10 minute drive from Glasgow centre. As you travel the 160ft
    height you will enjoy views of the surrounding areas including the Glasgow Harbour.
    As you reach the top you will have a few seconds to prepare before hearing the
    famous countdown "3, 2, 1, Bungee!" and then...it's up to you!
