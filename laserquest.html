    <p>
        The ultimate sci-fi action adventure for all ages. Whether you’re 7 or 77,
        you’ll love the adrenaline pumping exhilaration of stalking your opponents
        and unleashing a searing volley of laser fire in the battle zone of the 21st
        century. This is no video game – this is for REAL. <br>

        Laser Quest provides full briefings and all the equipment you need.
        Each player is kitted out with a futuristic body pack and carries a laser.
        Each game is played out in the Laser Quest labyrinth, with catwalks, mazes, swirling fog, music and lights.
        You score points when you zap your opponents but lose points when they zap you.
        Up to 25 players can compete in 20 minute sessions. From team to solo games, there is a format suitable for you.
        Scores are displayed on monitors at the end of the game with each player receiving their own score card.
