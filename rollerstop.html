        Rollerstop is a unique cultural venue that runs roller skating activities
        from it’s purpose built roller rink in Glasgow’s southside.

        Skating at Rollerstop is great fun & good exercise in a clean venue with a disco atmosphere.
        Rollerstop has excellent customer service provided by their skate coaches, who are on hand at every session.

        They run roller discos for families, skating club nights for adults,
        lessons for both adults & juniors along with specialist events for the LGBTQ+ community and families with additional support needs.

        Rollerstop began in 2012 as a mobile roller disco, travelling to many venues across Scotland with skates,
        a soundsystem, disco lights & a passionate team. After a crowdfunding campaign & community support,
        their rink was built in 2015 & they welcome 55,000 skaters through the door per year.
        Rollerstop are still passionate about skating & want to share the fun it brings with as many of you as they can!
