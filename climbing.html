        Founded in 1994, The Glasgow Climbing Centre was one of the first
        dedicated indoor climbing gyms in Scotland. Today it is the largest
        indoor roped climbing centre in the West of Scotland and the preferred
        training facility for many new and experienced climbers.

    <p>
        The centre has 58 panels with a range of Lead climbing, top rope
        and 13 autobelays with grades typically ranging from F3-F8a. We also
        have a bouldering area with problems typically ranging from font 4-7b
