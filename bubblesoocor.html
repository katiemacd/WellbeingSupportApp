    <p>
        We came up with the idea of Bubble Soccer back in early 2014, by the end
        of the year it became a massive hit! We had booking enquiries from all over
        Scotland, ranging from Parties, Weddings, Festivals you name it! Due to the
        popularity it enabled us to grow our business by adding more games to our portfolio.
        We now have over 10 different activities available to hire and are expanding
        across the rest of the UK with our brand new website Ultra Activities launching in 2021!
